# 2018-Tesla-Data-Breach
As part of this task I was required to map the Tesla Data Breach to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. From here I select any 2 specific ‘techniques’ from the incident and replicate both on a ‘proof of concept’ basis. This will allow me to display my understanding by synthesizing the selected technical techniques. I'll document 2 techniques in this repo.
