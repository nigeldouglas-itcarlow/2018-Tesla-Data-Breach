# 2018 Tesla Data Breach
As part of this task I was required to map the Tesla Data Breach to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. From here I select any <b>2 specific ‘techniques’</b> from the incident and replicate both on a ‘proof of concept’ basis. This will allow me to display my understanding by synthesizing the selected technical techniques. I'll document 2 techniques in this repo.
